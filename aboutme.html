      <h1> About Me </h1>
      <p> In my professional life I'm working toward getting a good scholarship for basketball and be able to pursue a degree which will lead me into getting some kind of career that has to do with using mathematical skills. I'm going to finish school, work towards pushing myself in basketball by going to camps and training all year long while trying to balance school and grades. The values I consider necessary are persistence and determination towards what you want to succeed in so that you get to your end goal. Even when you get to the end you have to be able to continue with it and not just do it for yourselves accomplishments and for the people around you although you should do things for yourself when it comes to getting things where you want. Some short term goals I hope to accomplish in the near future is to be able to get done with school and stay on it about my grades so I am qualified for a great scholarship and also to be great with my sports so that it can also bring attention from many great coaches. The character traits I would most want to be known is that people can come to me about anything, someone that can take charge in a situation where something went wrong, a person who can inspire people to be the better version of themselves and can keep everyone in track even when deadlines get close we can work together to get them done. </p>
